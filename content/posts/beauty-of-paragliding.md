One of the best extreme sport so far that I've known, Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.

But have you notice that skydiving and paragliding are the two most practiced air sports in the world. Skydiver and paraglider pilots have outnumbered base jumpers, tunnel flyers, and hang gliders by a huge ratio but, peoples often confuse the two practices.

**How Paragliding Works**  
Have you ever dream of flying out of nowhere, It means you are on top of particular and that you're enjoying a sense of power and freedom. And as you might know, dreaming of flying is quite common and it's a sign of good things to come.

In theory, is similar to hang-gliding. Hang glider has typically had an aluminum frame with a V-shaped wing. Instead of that, Paraglider has no frames, and the wing has an elliptically shaped parachute to the size of the backpack when it's not being used.

The paraglider is a little bit slower than the hang glider, which makes it easier for people to learn to fly them. FYI, there is one main difference. Paragliding pilot starts from the ground before winds take them up into the sky, They are starting from the ground with their parachutes already deploy.

**How to learn Paraglide**  
The first thing you need before paraglide is having a paragliding pilot certification instruction program. Some initial training for beginners usually begins with some amount of ground basic, including how to wear a harness or some theories of flight as well as basic structure and operation of the glider.

Students will learn how to control the basics of paraglider on the ground first, practicing how to control the parachute while taking off and controlling the wind 'overhead'.
